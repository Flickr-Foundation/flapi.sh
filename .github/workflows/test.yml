      # Dependabot doesn't have access to the secrets, so this will fail --
      # but that's probably okay.  The tests will run when we merge to main
      # so we'll still find out quickly if they don't work, but we won't
      # have a red X to dismiss in the GitHub UI.
      #
      # This is a bit fragile because it means PRs from third parties who
      # aren't Dependabot will fail in the same way -- but that doesn't
      # seem like it'll be a frequent occurrence, so this is good enough
      # for now.
